Indeed, to run this application, it’s necessary to use a local server because JavaScript modules (import/export) need to be served over an HTTP server to work correctly.
/////////////////////////////////////
With Visual Studio Code, the Go Live extension simplifies this task by quickly launching a local server. Here’s how to do it:

1 - Install the extension: If you haven’t already, install the Live Server extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

2 - Open the project: Make sure you have opened your project in Visual Studio Code.

3 - Start the server: Click on the Go Live button at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, or right-click on your index.html file and select Open with Live Server.

4 - Access the application: A new browser window will open automatically at http://127.0.0.1:5500 (or another port). You can now see your application in action.

This allows you to test and debug the application smoothly.
